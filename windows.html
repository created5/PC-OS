    <h1>Microsoft Windows</h1>
     
     <p>Microsoft Windows is the most common PC operating system used worldwide. But when was Windows' first iteration developed? How has it remained popular over the years? And what exactly happens when you click that start button? These questions and more will be answered here.</p>
     
     
     <h2>A Brief History of Windows</h2>
     <p>Although Windows is an operating system of it's own today, its initial form, Windows 1.0, was merely an extension of Microsoft's already existing OS, MS-DOS.
     First announced in 1983, 1.0 was released in November 1985, with the intention of competing with Apple's OS. As Windows 1.0 was merely an extension of DOS, it wasn't very popular.
     Since then, however, various updates and expansions culminated in Windows' modern reputation.</p>
     
     
     <h2>Windows Versions</h2>
     <ul>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_1.0">Windows 1.0</a> The original Windows. Could do everything DOS did, and then some.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.0">Windows 2.0</a> First instance of overlapping windows, Microsoft Office, and third-party support.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.1x">Windows 2.1x</a> Actually a pair of versions released simultaneously to take advantage of a pair of computers.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0">Windows 3.0</a> The first successful version of Windows, 3.0 revamped the user interface with accessibility in mind.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">Windows 3.1x</a> The last of the DOS-based Windows, 3.1x was more stable than 3.0, among a few other additions.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95">Windows 95</a> The first version to use the now-standard desktop layout, 95 was backwards-compatible with DOS, to the point that one could cancel the Windows startup.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98">Windows 98</a> 98 was, for the most part, an updated version of 95.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_ME">Windows ME</a> Released at the turn of the millenium, Windows ME was the first Windows OS to use the NT kernel, but a rush to the market meant it was bugged out.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">Windows XP</a> Like ME, Windows XP used the NT kernel. Unlike ME, XP was actually good, as its 12-year life cycle can attest to. That said, its lack of effective security led to many malware attacks.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista">Windows Vista</a> Vista, while it was more secure than XP, received a lot of flak for its sluggish operating speed.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7">Windows 7</a> 7 was much better received than Vista because 7 was just as secure, but faster. Also, 7 allowed users to pin their favorite programs to the taskbar.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8">Windows 8</a> Because it was released with a user interface designed for tablets so as to compete with Android and iOS, Windows 8 had a mixed reception. Ironically, its service pack Windows 8.1 was not obtainable via Windows Update.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10">Windows 10</a> The most up-to-date version of Windows, 10 seems to blend the styles of 7 and 8, with a Start menu in a tiled layout.</li>
     </ul>
