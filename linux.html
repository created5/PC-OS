        <h1>Linux</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Linux, like many of its antecedents, was based on Unix, an operating system as old as 1969. In 1991, Linus Torvalds, frustrated by the liscensing of MINIX, the last of Linux's antecedents, created his own operating system kernel -- the Linux kernel.</p>
